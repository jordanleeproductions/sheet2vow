## Roadmap & Next Features

### Phase 1: Onboarding & Setup Customization (Up Next)

1. **Modular Navigation & Feature Toggles**
   - **Module On/Off Switches:** Allow users during onboarding (and via Settings) to enable or disable individual modules (e.g., hide **Music Playlist**, **Vendors**, **Kanban**, or **Budget Ledger** if not needed).
   - **Dynamic Nav Chrome:** Top navbar and dashboard widgets dynamically hide disabled modules to keep the interface minimal and focused.

2. **Custom External Links & Platform Controls**
   - **Streaming Platform Chooser:** Allow users to choose which streaming platform buttons appear on Music cards (e.g., toggle Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, Tidal, or Soundcloud).
   - **Custom Tab Naming & Ordering:** Allow users to rename navigation tabs (e.g., rename `[ LEDGER ]` to `[ EXPENSES ]` or `[ GUEST LIST ]` to `[ RSVPs ]`).

3. **Onboarding Preset Packs**
   - Provide ready-to-use template presets during setup (e.g. *Micro Wedding*, *Destination Wedding*, *Traditional Large Wedding*) pre-populating suggested timeline milestones and budget categories.

### Phase 2: Public Guest Portal & Sharing

1. **Guest-Facing RSVP Portal**
   - Generate a lightweight, read-only public link for guests to submit their RSVP and dietary requirements directly into the planner without master edit access.

2. **Shareable Timeline for Vendors & Bridal Party**
   - Dedicated print/digital view of the Day-Of Timeline filtered by specific roles (e.g. a shareable link specifically for the Photographer or Caterer).

### Phase 3: Advanced Integrations & Automations

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Google Sheet Schema Presets** | One-click Google Sheet template cloning directly to user's Google Drive. |
| **Google Auth & Drive Storage** | Direct OAuth integration with Google Drive to auto-save and auto-sync changes. |
